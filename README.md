<b>Tool Used</b>: Microsoft SQL Server

Greetings! Welcome to the Bike Stores Data Analysis Project, where we embark on a journey through a rich dataset encompassing vital aspects of bike retail. Our exploration delves into the intricate details of stores, staff, products, customers, orders, and inventory.

**Database Structure and Schema**:
The dataset is structured with precision, adhering to a well-defined schema. The tables, including **sales.stores, sales.staffs, production.categories, production.brands, production.products, sales.customers, sales.orders, sales.order_items, and production.stocks**, form the backbone of our analysis, offering a comprehensive view of the bike retail ecosystem.

**Analytical Tool**:
For this exploration, we leverage the robust capabilities of Microsoft SQL Server, a powerful relational database management system. This tool provides a solid foundation for querying and analyzing large datasets, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in our data-driven investigations.

**Analysis**:

**1. Staff Productivity Analysis**: Utilizing JOINs and aggregation to identify top-performing staff based on total sales amount.

**2. Product Category Insights**: Employing JOINs and GROUP BY to determine the product category contributing the most to overall revenue.

**3. Brand Loyalty Analysis**: Harnessing the power of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to analyze customer loyalty and repeat purchase rates for specific brands.

**4. Order Delivery Analysis**: Calculating average delivery status for each city, involving CASE statements and DATEDIFF functions.

**5. Store Performance Analysis**: Deploying CTEs and window functions to calculate total revenue generated by each store in 2017.

**6. Managerial Hierarchy Overview**: Crafting hierarchical views through recursive CTEs, showcasing the organizational structure from store managers to their direct reports.
